The only thing you need is the .NET in the desktop development package. You can also choose other packages if you are interested in them, but the more packages you choose, the more space it will take on your computer, and the data it will consume.

5. You can either select a new location to install Visual Studio or use the default location. `Note: Don't touch it if you don't know anything about it. and don't check any box if you don't know what it does.`
